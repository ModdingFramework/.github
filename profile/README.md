<br/>

This "**Modding Framework**" was created so that modders could use these tools to mod things like:
- old games, now in the public domain
- games from publishers that allow reverse engineering their games

It's all about having **fun**.

These tools are **NOT** intended to **EVER** be used to do things like:
- cheat in multiplayer games
- pirate games

I'm not just saying that. That is just _straight up_ not what this framework does.
If you unfamiliar with what "reverse engineering-based modding" is and you think it's about piracy/etc,
I advocate that you checkout some of the _thriving_ modding communities for various games
which grow the user-base (_read: more people buying the game_) and provide amazing features in the game. Some examples:
- Bethesda games can be modded using a framework like this one, e.g. Skyrim uses "SKSE" (Oblivion/OBSE) (Morrowind/MWSE) (Falllout 3/FOSE) (Fallout New Vegas/NVSE)
- Stardew Valley can be modded using a framework like this one called "SMAPI"

That being said, you might not want your game to be modded using this framework.

[This GitHub org](https://github.com/ModdingFramework) includes some mini-modding frameworks for lots of games as demos of the framework.
I try to only create demos for games which are at least 20+ years old & created by developers who have no known history of suing
those who reverse engineering their games & published by companies that have no known history of suing those who reverse engineering their games. 

> _Notable exceptions to my 20+ year old rule are: Bethesda games + Stardew Valley_

If you are the publisher/developer of a game and you find that your game is being used as a demo
here at https://github.com/ModdingFramework then you can message me directly and I will _immediately_
remove your game and all references to it from this GitHub organization, if those are your wishes.

The best way to reach me is via Discord. You can find me via [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/d96UKrKead). Send me a DM.

> ^--- _if the invite link doesn't work anymore, try finding one from https://mrowrpurr.com or https://github.com/mrowrpurr_

Thank you for your support and understanding! I hope this tool helps breathe new life into some very old games.

# Modding Framework

This software is intended to allow you to make your *own* modding framework for *any game.*

If you have ever used software such as Cheat Engine, IDA Pro, or Ghidra - *then this is for you!*

> **Ok, well... the software doesn't exist _yet_. But we're working on it!**

When ready, this framework should allow you to create mods using:
- any native language which can export C functions (C++, Rust, etc)
- JavaScript
- Python
- Ruby
- Lua
