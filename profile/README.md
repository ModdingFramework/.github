# Modding Framework

This software is intended to allow you to make your *own* modding framework for *any game.*

If you have ever used software such as Cheat Engine, IDA Pro, or Ghidra - *then this is for you!*

Ok, well... the software doesn't exist _yet_. But we're working on it!

When ready, this framework should allow you to create mods using:
- any native language which can export C functions (C++, Rust, etc)
- JavaScript
- Python
- Ruby
- Lua
